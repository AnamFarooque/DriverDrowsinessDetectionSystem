Objectives:-
(1)I have developed k-means clustering algorithms to group student data based on their attributes. 
(2)After grouping in 2nd step, I have validated the studentâ€™s groups in a different context and examine the subgroups where there is variation in student parameters.
(3)In the last step I have calculated their percentage into success and failure and compared results of all clusters.
(4) Created different charts for better vision of the results
